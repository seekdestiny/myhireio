Hireio shipping proceure
================

### Checkout and pull master
### Create a new branch locally
### Finish your development and commit all the changes
### Do a thorough test! This step is very important at this stage as we have no test for now! We rely on you to provide reliable code!
### Push your development branch onto Github and Yinfei will make sure it gets reviewed (ping Yinfei once it's available on Github). Hopefully, once more people know our code style, we'll have more reviewers.
### Address all the comments and reply them with your thought or a commit. (This step can be tedious but it's a great learning experience!!)
### Now you can merge it onto master and check off the task on Asana!
